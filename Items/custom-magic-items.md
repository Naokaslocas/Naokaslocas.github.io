# Custom Magic Items for Level 2 Party

## 1. Seedling Stone (for Genasi Druid)

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This smooth, egg-sized stone has a faint green glow and is warm to the touch. Tiny roots occasionally sprout from its surface, only to recede moments later.

**Properties:**
- As an action, you can plant this stone in soil and cause a 5-foot-radius circle of lush vegetation to sprout instantly. This vegetation is difficult terrain and provides half cover.
- Once per long rest, you can cast Goodberry without using a spell slot.
- While holding this stone, you have advantage on Nature checks related to plants.

**Attunement:** This item requires attunement by a druid. While attuned, your druidic focus can be channeled through this stone.

**Roleplaying Note:** The stone seems to resonate with the elemental nature of the Genasi, sometimes mimicking their mood with its plant growth.

## 2. Tinkerer's Multitool (for Gnome Artificer/Rogue)

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This intricate metal tool about the size of a dagger can reshape itself into various forms. Its surface is covered in tiny gears and mystical runes.

**Properties:**
- As a bonus action, you can transform this tool into any simple tool or thieves' tools. It remains in this form until you use a bonus action to change it again.
- Once per short rest, you can cast Mending without using a spell slot.
- While using this tool, you have advantage on ability checks made to craft or repair non-magical objects.

**Attunement:** This item requires attunement by an artificer or rogue. While attuned, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability check made using this tool, even if you're not normally proficient with that type of tool.

**Roleplaying Note:** The tool seems to have a mischievous personality, sometimes playfully changing forms when idle.

## 3. Whispering Bow (for Wood Elf Ranger)

*Weapon (shortbow), uncommon*

This elegant shortbow appears to be grown rather than crafted, with living wood that subtly shifts and leaves that occasionally sprout along its length.

**Properties:**
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon.
- Once per short rest, you can cast Speak with Animals without using a spell slot.
- As a bonus action, you can command an arrow fired from this bow to emit dim light in a 10-foot radius for 1 minute or until the arrow is removed from where it landed.

**Attunement:** This item requires attunement by a ranger. While attuned, you can use a bonus action to magically create one arrow. This arrow disappears after 1 minute if not used.

**Roleplaying Note:** The bow occasionally whispers secrets of the forest to its wielder, providing insights into the natural world.

## DM Notes

### Balancing Considerations
- These items provide utility and flavor without significantly increasing combat power.
- Each item requires attunement, limiting overall magic item usage.
- Abilities are limited by rests to prevent overuse.

### Potential Plot Hooks
1. **Seedling Stone:** 
   - The stone might be sought after by a druidic circle for a important ritual.
   - It could react strangely in areas of corrupted nature, providing clues.

2. **Tinkerer's Multitool:**
   - The runes might be part of a larger puzzle or code.
   - An inventor might seek out the wielder to study this unique creation.

3. **Whispering Bow:**
   - The bow's whispers could provide cryptic clues about forest-related quests.
   - A group of wood elves might recognize it as a long-lost relic.

### Scaling
As the characters level up, consider allowing these items to grow in power:

- **Seedling Stone:** Could eventually allow casting of Plant Growth once per day.
- **Tinkerer's Multitool:** Might gain the ability to transform into more complex tools or even simple weapons.
- **Whispering Bow:** Could increase to a +2 bonus and allow casting of higher-level druid spells.

### Distribution
Present these items as rewards for completing a significant quest or as treasured gifts from a grateful NPC. Consider creating a short story or legend for each item to increase their significance to the players.
