# Lost and found

## Story
The players need to find the bandit camp but need to decide what to do with Justus, he needs to convince the party to let him live, Kiln can intimidate him by constantly being with him.


Maelor can't sense the village, so they decide to search for the bandits instead.

    Scenario (A): the players disguise as the slain bandits and go into the camp posing as them, Kiln will have to stay next to Justus the brave at all times.

    Scenario (B): plyers go in and try to reason with the camp, Alaric will enforce this approach



After finding the bandit camp, players find out that the slain bandits were new recruits and find out the story behind the ambushed wagon and the missing bandit leader

    The bandit leader went into the woods by himself, his most trusty companions and a ranger that they hired, Maelor's crush, for a secret assignment. The rest of the crew stayed behind, waiting for new orders but they never came, so they splitted up after an argument about leadership. The loyal members stayed together and eventually tracked down a pack of goblins that was seen with the same hired ranger. So Raven believe the ranger double-crossed them and got them captured or something.

    The bandits that left wanted to intercept an important shipment and decided to do it by themselves, and got lost for a day until they followed the sound of a skirmish but arrived to find the destroyed caravan and the players.   

    The wagon was attacked by cultists intercepting the shipment, by the time the bandits found it, it had been already looted and the storm must have erased any trail left to follow.

The storm stops and the party is able to go and track the goblins, they eventually find the goblins at the foot of an elder tree, next to a passage carved from the roots. the entrance is blocked by an automaton pretending to be a root... inside the cave sounds of slashing and chopping is going on, goblins digging deeper into the tree, roots of the magical forest are processed to make automatons, traces uf that process can be seen around the cave.

After the encounter, the party finds a map probably made by a ranger, detailing the location of goblin camps, some next to elvish vilages, including the one that they where looking for before and the one were Maelor's crush is.
