## Encounter Setup
The encounter takes place at the base of the Elder Tree, near the entrance to the underground cave.

1. Terrain:
   - Dense forest surroundings with difficult terrain
   - Large tree roots providing partial cover
   - A small clearing (20 ft. radius) in front of the cave entrance

2. Initial Positioning:
   - 2 Goblins and 1 Lesser Wood Automaton patrolling the perimeter
   - Goblin Boss, 2 Hobgoblins, and 1 Lesser Wood Automaton near the cave entrance
   - 2 Goblins and 1 Lesser Wood Automaton inside the cave, visible from the entrance

3. Tactics:
   - Patrolling enemies will alert others if they spot the party
   - Goblins use hit-and-run tactics, utilizing their Nimble Escape
   - Hobgoblins focus on protecting the Goblin Boss
   - Lesser Wood Automatons use their Thorn Spray when multiple enemies are clustered
   - Goblin Boss uses Redirect Attack to protect himself

## Encounter Dynamics
1. Stealth Approach: Allow players to attempt sneaking up on the patrol. If successful, they can gain surprise.
2. Terrain Advantage: Encourage creative use of the environment, such as using tree roots for cover or setting traps.
3. Cave Entrance: The narrow entrance can be used strategically by both sides.
4. Escalation: If the battle goes poorly for the goblins, the inside group may attempt to collapse the cave entrance to buy time.

## Treasure
- 150 gp worth of mixed coins and small valuables
- A map fragment showing other goblin camps (plot hook)
- 1 Potion of Healing
- A strange, partially completed wooden construct (clue to automaton creation)

## Adjusting Difficulty
- Easier: Remove 1-2 Goblins or a Lesser Wood Automaton
- Harder: Add another Hobgoblin or Lesser Wood Automaton, or give the Goblin Boss a special ability or magic item

## Follow-up
- Investigating the cave may reveal more about the automaton creation process
- Captured enemies could provide information about the larger goblin operation or the missing ranger
