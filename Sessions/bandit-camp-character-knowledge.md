# Bandit Camp Knowledge: Carlo and Justus

## Carlo the Swift (Well-established, liked member)

The Bandit group, formerly led by Hawk, is now under the leadership of the second in command, Raven. Hawk is a man of big ambitions and bigger charisma, everyone looks up to him. Following a streak of success the fame and numbers of the group have increased, and Hawk became more and more difficult to approach except by Raven and the raid captain "Lungs"(place holder name but if asked you can call it like that).

Recently "Lungs", Hawk and a small part of the team left without explaining much but everyone followed him without question. Except for the newest recruits, they decided to go into the woods by themselves to ambush and loot a caravan.
